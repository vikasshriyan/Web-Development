<h3>NodeJS and OpenShift</h3>
<p>
    During the sixth week, Prof. Jose started with a new technology from the MEAN Stack called NodeJS. During the two lectures, prof. taught the very basics of NodeJS. Nodejs is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications.
    Nodejs applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, Linux and FreeBSD.
    Nodejs provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability.
    These technologies are commonly used for real-time applications. You can download NodeJS from <a href="http://nodejs.org/">here</a>.<br/>
    NodeJS for me is a very new technology which I haven't used ever before. During these two lectures what I learnt is that you can host your own server locally.
    From these two lectures I learnt the various opertaions or methods such as <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>delete</code> and <code>PUT</code> which are used to fetch data from the server, push data onto the client, to remove a data field and modify a data field respectively.
    The experiments are been done locally first and then hosted on Openshift. You can find the links to the Openshift server in each experiment.
    The data is persisted when we use NodeJS that means even on refreshing the page, the changes still stay. 
    The list of experiments that I've done during this week are:<br />
   1. Introduction to NodeJS<br />
   2. Echo back the parameter passed in request<br />
   3. Static JSON responses using NodeJS<br />
   4. Open custom HTML from Server<br />
   5. Form using NodeJS<br />
