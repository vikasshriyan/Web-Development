<h3>Week-2 Responsive Design and Bootstrap</h3>
<p>
    During the second week, prof. Jose started with Responsive Design. Responsive Design is a technique to target different devices such as laptop, tablet, phone. When the window is resized, the page responds to it and changes its layout. I implemented three different experiments on Responsive Design.
    Due to the Blizzard, the first lecture of the week got cancelled. Bootstrap was taught in the second lecture. Bootstrap is a fine technology in today's age for web developers. People use bootstrap to style and their websites and try to make it look professional.
    I implemented a Demo Home Page experiment using Bootstrap. I then started with basic jquery experiment which included modal and a username, password validation.
