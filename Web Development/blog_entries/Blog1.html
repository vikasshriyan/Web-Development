<h3>Week 1- HTML and CSS</h3>
<p>
   During the first week, prof. Jose taught us HTML and some basic elements of it. We were told to use this in our experiments, which I did for the first week.
    Second week, prof. Jose continued with some CSS elements and a responsive design during his class. I implemented the elements he taught in class in my experiments for week1.
