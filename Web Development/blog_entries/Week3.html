<h3>JQuery</h3>
<p>
    During the third week, Prof. Jose started with basic JQuery introduction which included manipulating the DOM elements using jquery.
    In his second lecture, he taught about the jquery UI which can downloaded or used as a link and which can be used to add UI to your page.
    He taught the draggable, resizable features of UI and implemented using jquery.
    I learned quite a few things in jquery this week. I learned how the CSS of the HTML tags can be manipulated using JQuery which I have also done as an experiment.
    I learned the different jquery UI which can be used to improve or make your page more interactive.
    The list of experiments that I've done during this week are:<br/>
    1. JQuery with CSS (CSS properties of DOM objects is manipulated using Jquery)<br/>
    2. JQuery-Fading Image <br />
    3. JQuery-Resizable Image<br />
    4. JQuery UI-Draggable elements<br />
    5. JQuery UI- Sortable and Accordion elements<br />
