<h3>AJAX and AngularJS</h3>
<p>
    During the fouth week, Prof. Jose started with AJAX and AngularJS which was very new to me. I used these technologies in my experiments which are listed below.
    From what I learnt, AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is mainly used for exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page.
    In my first experiment, I have used AJAX and used an IMDB api to render objects in JSONP format and displayed it on my HTML page.
    AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. Its goal is to simplify both development and testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used in rich internet applications.<br />
    You can download the AngularJS from <a href="https://angularjs.org/">here</a>.
    I've implemented the next five experiments using AngularJS. AngularJS as a technology has intrigued me a lot. Once can do major of the server-side work on the client side itself
    Main thing to remember about is using the <code>ng-app</code>,<code>ng-controller</code>,<code>ng-model</code> and linking it to the HTML and js files.<br/>
    The list of experiments that I've done during this week are:<br />
    1. AJAX Implementation (IMDB)<br/>
    2. AngularJS (Use of Controller)<br />
    3. AngularJS (Calculator)<br />
    4. AngularJS (DOM modification on client side)<br />
    5. AngularJS (Form)<br />
    6. AngularJS (Logo Quiz)<br/>
