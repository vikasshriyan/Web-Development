<h3>AngularJS- Routing Module</h3>
<p>
    During the fifth week, Prof. Jose continued with AngularJS techonology. He taught us that the main module which we used to create like in the last week's experiments can be dependent on different modules as well.
    I used a module called <code>ngAnimate</code> in my first to two experiments just to get familiar with the dependency of the modules on each other.
    Prof. Jose mainly concentrated on a module called <code>ngRoute</code> which is a clever technique to route to different areas of an HTML page without the pages actually getting reloaded.
    This single page application has been for a while and it's commonly used. This is a technique which caught my interest and I'm thinking of using it in my project.
    I've have used this technique in the other four experiments that I've done for this week.
    The list of experiments that I've done during this week are:<br />
   1. AngularJS(Dynamic Search)<br />
   2. AngularJS(Animation)<br />
   3. AngularJS(Movie Library)<br />
   4. AngularJS(Routing Introduction)<br />
   5. AngularJS(Movie Library using Routing)<br />
   6. AngularJS(Piazza Demo site using Routing)<br />
