            <h4>Code Snippet:</h4>
            <code>
                I'm using the CSS1 and CSS2 class in the 'p' tag to differentiate what CSS properties I want to apply to both of them.
                On click, I want to change the CSS properties so I use the .css class to set different properties such as the background color, font-color, etc.
                On refresh, I reload the page using '.reload' function.<br/><br/>
                $(document).ready(function () <br/>
                {<br />
                $(".CSS1").click(function () // p tag with CSS1 class. <br />
                {<br />
                $(this).css({ // Setting different properties using .css function.<br /> 
                "background-color": "blue",<br />
                "color":"white",<br />
                "font-style": "italic",<br />
                "fontFamily": "Impact,Charcoal,sans-serif"<br />
                })<br />
                });<br /><br />

                $(".CSS2").click(function () // p tag with CSS1 class.<br />
                {<br />
                $(this).css({ // Setting different properties using .css function <br />
                "background-color": "red",<br />
                "font-style": "bold",<br />
                "fontFamily": "Courier New"<br />
                })<br />
                });<br /><br />

                $(".CSS3").click(function () { // h tag with CSS3 class, <br />
                $(".CSS3").css({  // Setting different properties using .css function<br />

                })<br />
                });<br /><br />

                $(".CSS4").click(function () { //h tag with CSS4 class<br />
                $(".CSS4").css({  // Setting different properties using .css function<br />
                "background-image": 'url("http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/53/Arsenal_FC.svg")',<br />

                "font-size": "0"<br />
                })<br /><br />

                {<br />
