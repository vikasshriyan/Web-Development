    <h3><u>About the Experiment</u></h3>
    <p>
        AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. Its goal is to simplify both development and testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used in rich internet applications.<br />
        You can download the AngularJS from <a href="https://angularjs.org/">here</a>.<br />
        In this experiment, I've started with the basic Routing concept of Angular JS.
        When the user clicks on the various tabs on the home page, it navigates to different pages such as about, contact and profile, without the the pages actually getiing reloaded.
    The main advantage of using routing is that you can display different areas of a single HTML page in various pages without the pages actually getting reloaded.

        <h3><u>Code Snippet</u></h3>
        <p>
        Initially, I've loaded the <code>ng-app</code> module from my HTML and linked it and I've also loaded the<code>ngRoute</code> module for the routing to work.
        I've then initialized the <code>config</code> function and used the <code>routeProvider</code> for the routing to different pages.
        When the user clicks on the home tab, the <code>routeProvider</code> checks for the <code>/home</code> in the HTML and routes the user to the Home page in the given URL.
        I then use the same logic to route to different pages in the HTML.

            <u>Javascript Code</u><br />
            var app = angular.module("myApp", ['ngRoute']); // load the main and ngRoute module.<br />

            app.config(['$routeProvider', // routing purpose<br />
            function ($routeProvider) {<br />
            $routeProvider.<br />
            when('/home', {<br />
            templateUrl: 'ng-Route/home.html',<br />

            }).<br />
            when('/about', {<br />
            templateUrl: 'ng-Route/about.html<br />

            })<br />
            .when('/contact', {<br />
            templateUrl: 'ng-Route/contact.html',<br />

            })<br />
            .when('/profile', {<br />
            templateUrl: 'ng-Route/profile.html',<br />

            }).<br />
            otherwise({<br />
            redirectTo: '/home'<br />
            });<br />
            }]);<br />
