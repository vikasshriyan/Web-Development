        <h3><u>About the Experiment</u></h3>
        <p>
            AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. Its goal is to simplify both development and testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used in rich internet applications.<br />
            You can download the AngularJS from <a href="https://angularjs.org/">here</a>.<br />
            In this experiment, I make use of a JSON array object
            that contains records of a certain number of students.Using this data I can search for these students
            and the result shows up dynamically by making use of Angular's filter to filter the results. <br />

        </p><hr />

            <h3><u>Code Snippet</u></h3>
            <p>
                Here, I've initially loaded the AngularJS module using <code>.module</code> function in the js file and linking it using <code>ng-app</code> in the HTML file.
            I also use the another module called <code>ng-animate</code> which depends on my search module.
                Using the <code>app</code> namespace and the <code>controller</code> function, linking the <code>ng-controller</code> SearchController in the HTML page, I then declare a function with <code>$scope</code>
                parameter. Many students are declared in the array.
            </p><br />
            <code>
                var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngAnimate']); // load the angular module<br/>

                myApp.controller('MyController', function MyController($scope) { // load the controller and the function<br />
                $scope.artists = [<br />
